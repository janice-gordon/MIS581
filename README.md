## Abstract

The opioid crisis in the United States has claimed over 450,000 lives (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) and drug poisoning is now the number one cause of mortality from injury, surpassing motor vehicle accidents (National Center for Health Statistics, 2018). The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is the lead government organization focused on researching the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of drug abuse and the disease of addiction (National Institutes of Health, 2018), making NIDA central in the fight against opioid addiction. Even as some gains have been made with prescription opioid and heroin death rates decreasing slightly, illicitly manufactured opioid related mortalities are on the rise (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). NIDAâ€™s work fighting the opioid health crisis can be accelerated through data analytics, determining trends, making predictions and ultimately informing future treatment and prevention efforts. This study will focus on understanding the geographic disparities in synthetic opioid overdose mortality rates between HHS regions in order to provide insights to NIDA for the distribution of resources to highly affected and at risk regions.
